Revision history for Perl extension Text::Patch::Rred.

0.06  Thu Nov 26 20:09:00 2009
   - Updated bug reporting instructions to point to the e-mail address
    registered with PAUSE.
   - Signed the package with real gpg key for the bug reporting e-mail
    address.

0.05  Fri Oct 30 20:28:00 2009
   - Use two splice calls, not a big temporary array when skipping backwards
    or forwards more than 1000 lines from one command to the next.  This is
    significantly reduced memory consumption.

0.04  Thu Aug 13 10:59:00 2009
	- Use string references, not actual strings in the internal array of
	   lines to avoid wasting lots of memory and cycles on needless string
	   copying (it seems that perl does not do lazy string copying the way
	   many other systems do).
	- Relax the license to allow the version 5.60 to 5.83 perl licenses too
	   (no real difference in practice, but simplifies Debian packaging).
	- Remove the temporary "unreleased" license prefix.
	- Add support for Module::Build in addition to MakeMaker.
	- Added Pod::Coverage and Perl::Critic tests and made them pass.

0.03  Sat Jul 12 23:48:00 2008
	- Include rred.pl in Makefile.pl, so it will be installed

0.02  Mon Jun 16 00:53:00 2008
	- Renamed to Rred to match the rred name used by Debian apt internals.

0.01  Fri May  5 23:58:16 2006
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AX -n Text::Patch::EdSafe
