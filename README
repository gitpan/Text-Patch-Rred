Text::Patch::Rred version 0.06
==============================

This module and program safely and securely applies one or more
ed-style patches as produced by the command diff --ed oldfile
newfile.  It does exactly what you tell it to and no more, even with
wildly bad or evil input.

Unlike the traditional programs patch, ed, red and sed, rred does
not allow the data in the patch to run arbitrary commands, read or
write files or otherwise cause havoc.  Only the handful of safe
"commands" actually used by diff are recognized and processed.

Unlike the patch program and the perl modules Text::Patch,
PatchReader and Meta::Development::Patch, this module does NOT try to
doubleguess what kind of data it is given or which file to process.

(Note that the other perl modules just mentioned cannot actually
apply an ed-style patch, though some can parse it).

The name rred is short for "Really Restricted ED" (as compared to red(1)). 
This is the name given to a similar utility used inside the Debian projects
apt facility.
